# SnakeRL

# TODO:
Create a base layout for the game
 - Have different sized boards
 - Have different speeds at which objects appear on the board
 - Have different colors the player or agent can choose from for their snake to be

Create a RL Program
 - The agent must understand how the game works and what the objectives are towards completion
 - The agent should be rewarded for doing correct things, and penalized for doing something incorrect
 - The agent should work on getting better and better

Create a Progression Check
 - Be able to track the agent's progress at different stages, showing how it learns and develops new strategies in order to succeed
